sudo nmcli connection


# Example
sudo nmcli con mod {connectionNameHere} ipv4.dns "192.168.2.254 192.168.2.18"

sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service


# OR
sudo nmcli connection reload

# Verify it by using the grep command and cat command and host command
cat /etc/resolv.conf


grep DNS /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ovirtmgmt
# Example Output
grep DNS /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-ovirtmgmt

# Create a Sudo User on CentOS
# A sudo user is a super user in Linux. There are several ways to accomplish this task, but simplest is to add the user to the wheel group.

# In the following example, the new user student1 is added to the wheel group, giving him sudo rights.

sudo useradd -G wheel -c "Student1 is an admin" student1



# To install htop on Oracle Linux 8, you can use the following command
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install htop

# This command first installs the EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) repository, which contains additional packages not included in the default Oracle Linux repositories. Then, it installs htop from the EPEL repository.
